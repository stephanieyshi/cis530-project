# Evaluation Metrics
There are several evaluation metrics, which tend to relate to vector distance, that have been used in literature to evaluate the results of debiasing. Since there is literature that shows that existing attempts to debias word embeddings have been insufficient, we believe it is best to use a variety of evaluation metrics to compare the results that have been done so far.

## Metric 1: Projection
### Direct Bias


## Metric 2: Pearson Correlation

## Metric 3: WEAT

## Metric 4: Clustering
